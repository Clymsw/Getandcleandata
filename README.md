# Coursera course project for Getting and Cleaning Data

The script run_analysis.R does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Steps 

1. Download the data from the link in the project site for the course. 
2. Copy the script run_analysis.R to the same folder that UCI HAR Dataset is in, then set set the working directory here.
3. Run run_analysis.R, which will generate a tiny data contained in tiny_data.txt.
